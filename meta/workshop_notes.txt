sage jenson + eva fineberg

* not advertised as a coding workshop
* blanket function that generates audio from any file (image, etc.)
* limit to words (fluxus scoring, poetry, etc.)
* visual representations of algorithmic metaprocess (how to makefile, etc.)
* poetic composition side, set of instructions about how you want to write
* coding itself is set of strict rules with great freedom possible from within them
* interface is simple, but mental model is complex as you want it to be

audience:
* experimental word and composer folks

workshop prep:
* design considerations:
    - what input to allow (e.g. images, microphone, midi, arduino, etc.)
    - how to generate sound from the input
    - stations idea (how to we interact with non-computer materiality)
    - words map to aesthetic sounds that we build from simple components as example
    - immediately able to make something

rule assignment
    - names for sounds
    - microphone in

* code components to write
